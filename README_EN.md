# YouShouChat
A Role-Play Chat LLM Based on Fabulous Beasts (有兽焉). Currently supports chatting with PiPi, whose memories are limited to events before chapter 500.
## Current Version:
:one: Tianlu_0.5.1.dev
  - Quite aggressive. Be careful not to end up in his mouth!
  - May have messed memories with hallucinated content. We are working on fixing that!
  - _**Spoiler Content**_ :no_entry_sign:: This version of PiPi is not aware of his *** and the DEATH of ***. Ask him if you doubt about that!

## Current Status: 
:white_check_mark: On Test

<!-- :no_entry: Service Down, Under Maintainance -->

YouShouChat opens through a very simple Gradio demo, currently supports 20 rounds of chat hisory (will empty history once exceed). Better to use Chinese.

Your feedback and suggestions are highly welcome!
